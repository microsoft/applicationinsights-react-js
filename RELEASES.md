- Updates React Plugin to v3.3.3 (with v2.8.3 as dependency) -- using React 17

This release has been manually validated to work with IE8 both directly and by extending the provided classes. While the previous version 2.8.2 also fully supported IE8 it did not handle classes extending the all of Core classes correctly in multiple cases. If you need to support IE8 it is strongly advised that you upgrade to, validate and use this version.

## 3.3.0 (Apr 16th, 2022)

- [Released from ApplicationInsights Repo](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS)
- Updates React Plugin to v3.3.0 (with v2.8.0 as dependency) -- using React 17

### Potential Breaking Change

- `fetch` Ajax tracking was also been change to be on by default from this version moving forward, if you are running in an environment without `fetch` support and you are using an incompatible polyfill (that doesn't identify itself as a polyfill) or the SDK you start seeing recursive or duplicate (`fetch` and `XHR` requests) being reported you WILL need to add `disableFetchTracking` with a value of `true` to your configuration to disable this functionality.
- TypeScript 4.x required for some typings from the core EnumHelperFuncs.d.ts  (Fixed in v2.8.1)

### Significant changes

This release adds support for the SDK to

- TelemetryInitializers have been moved to `BaseCore` so they are now available as part of all Sku's and not just those using the `analytics` plugin (@microsoft/applicationinsights-analytics-js) using the `appInsights.addTelemetryInitializer(...)`
- Web Events (addEventHandler) now support "event namespaces" (similar to jQuery) to enable the removing of events by just specifying the namespace and new specific `eventOn(...)` and `eventOff(...)` API's.
- Fully unload, removing all internal event handlers (may be re-initialized) via the `appInsights.unload(...)` function.
- Dynamically add a plugin to an already initialized SDK (optionally replacing an existing) via new `appInsights.addPlugin(...)` function
- New helper to get any plugin from an initialized SDK via `appInsights.getPlugin("...identifier...")`
- Dynamically remove a plugin via the `appInsights.getPlugin("...identifier..").remove()`
- Enable / Disable any plugin (even if the plugin doesn't support disabling itself) via `appInsights.getPlugin("...identifier...").setEnabled(true/false)`
- The standard name fro the `analytics` plugin @microsoft/applicationinsights-analytics-js has been renamed and is now exported as `AnalyticsPlugin`, for backward compatibility it is also exported as it's previous name `ApplicationInsights`, if you are using it directly it is recommended that you update to use the new exported name.

While this release contains a substantial amount of additional functionality and code, there has also been significant minification efforts (which also drove some of the SDK naming) to keep the minified code around the same size. We intend to keep working on additional improvements to attempt to bring the size changes down further. However, the minification improvements do generally cause a lower level of GZip compression most because of the removal of duplicate names. The main readme for the [AISKU](https://github.com/microsoft/ApplicationInsights-JS/tree/master/AISKU) has a table of the CDN base SKU sizes, as the CDN version includes all public API's (older versions for backward compatibility and newer smaller versions) when using NPM you should see smaller sizes than those shown.

> Note:
> Due to the above changes required to support the above, there may be some minor TypeScript Type compatibility warnings when you attempt to use components from v2.8.0 with older SDK's (forward compatibility), backward compatibility, using Core v2.8.0 with older components is supported and v2.8.0 is completely backward compatible. This is due to some API's now support both older (for back compat) and new enhanced arguments, we have attempted to keep these changes to a minimum.
> If you are getting typing errors such as "Argument of type 'XXXXX' os not assignable to parameter of type 'YYYY'", please ensure that you are using all v2.8.0 components and raise an issue if this does not resolve you issue. As a work around casting to work around this warning should not cause any issues.

> Due the the size of this change, the above date is the NPM release date and CDN deployment will be over an extended period.
